# Lesson 3 - Dimensions of a room

Create a function that takes in a number as a parameter. in that function, I want you to figure out how many odd numbers exist between 0 and the number you entered.  Then return the sum total numbers of odd numbers.

for example

```
let result = findNumberOfOdds(8);
console.log(result);  // 4,  because the odd numbers between 0 and 8 is 1, 3, 5, 7
```


make sure you define your function in the main function call (you should see in the comments in the javascript file).  also make sure you are calling your new function inside your main function.
