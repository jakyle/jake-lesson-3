# Lesson 3 - Dimensions of a room

Create a function that takes in a number as a parameter. in that function, I want you to figure out how many odd numbers exist between 0 and the number you entered.  Then return the sum total numbers of odd numbers.

for example

```
let result = findNumberOfOdds(8);
console.log(result);  // 4,  because the odd numbers between 0 and 8 is 1, 3, 5, 7
```
